# CryptoTeX

CryptoTeX is a LaTeX template which is optimized for writing LaTeX for cryptography research. It includes common packages and macros, flags for common conference formats, and uses [cryptobib](https://cryptobib.di.ens.fr/) with cross-references for easy citation management.

**THIS REPO IS NOT KEEPING TRACK OF CHANGES IN CONFERENCE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING YOUR MANUSCRIPT MEETS THE CONFERENCE SUBMISSION GUIDELINES.**
